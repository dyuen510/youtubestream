This app was created with MERN.

By using MongoDB as the database we are able to capture the user info when they successfully signs up and by using password hashing we are able to strengthen the security for the users. 

Another feature on the app is the ability to have real time chat globally with all users in one chat box. This was allowed by implementing socket.io.
